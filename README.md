- Learned to **calculate percentages, averages, and discounts** efficiently in Java.
- Understood how to **use variables** effectively to store and manipulate data.
- Practiced **logic building** for small programs involving distribution, conversions, and calculations.
- Learned to **combine multiple outputs** in a single print statement, making code cleaner.
- Strengthened my **problem-solving mindset** by translating everyday scenarios into Java programs.
- Improved ability to **break down problems into simple steps** and implement them in code.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to **build a strong foundation in basic Java programming**, improve logical thinking, and track daily progress during the training period.
